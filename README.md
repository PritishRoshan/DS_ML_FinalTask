# DS_ML_FinalTask
In the past one month (36 days to be specific) I have learnt some beginner level concepts regrading data science and machine learning through this spectrum Internship Drive starting from ground level basics of dataset and data science to building a machine learning model for high accuracy grade prediction.
1. TASK 1:
In the first task I was required to do some basic database management to process Billy's score with no. of days he studied and plot a scatter plot which helped me to analyse different datasets to obtain multiple characteristics from this using differnt packages such as numpy, pandas, etc.
2. TASK 2:
The second task is based on data science where its asked to calculate the final grade of Billy in maths from his annual gradesheet by taking a mean of previous grades G1, G2 and G3 and then to plot a scatter plot and box plot between his study time and the final grade he obtained. For the purpose of this task I used pandas to create dataframe and then some basic math tool such as mean to calculate the final grade by taking a mean of previous grade obtained.
3. FINAL TASK:
And lastly in the final task I was required to build a machine learning model that will help Billy in predicting his final grade without entering all data with a high accuracy. Here Linear Regression model is used to fit the train model to test or predict the final grade and to obtain high accuracy in the predicted value with lowest possible data available I used backward elimination using statsmodels.api's OLS(Ordinary Least Squares).
4. FUTURE SCOPE:
In this current scenario when the world is facing the fate of Covid-19(Coronavirus) its not possible for the students to attend their classes in their Institutes and thus examination also. So this this model of predicting grades of students from their past grades and other attributes will standout in this situation and will help in predicting their results without conducting any examination from attributes such as attendance, previous sessions or semester examinations.
5. DEPENDENCY OF THE MODEL BUILT:
The model that has been developed/built for predicting a student's final grade mostly depends on his age, family realytionship, attendance and previous grades. According to student age his/hers knowledge gains and family relations matters a lot in the scores of a student similar to his/hers attendance.
